# Claude Code Discord Bot

A Discord bot that runs Claude Code sessions on different projects based on Discord channel names. Each channel maps to a folder in your file system, allowing you to interact with Claude Code for different repositories through Discord.

## Quickstart

1. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
2. Create a Discord bot at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
3. Clone and setup:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd claude-code-discord
   bun install
   ```
4. Create `.env` file:
   ```env
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   ALLOWED_USER_ID=your_discord_user_id_here
   BASE_FOLDER=/path/to/your/repos
   ```
5. Run: `bun start`

## Features

- **Channel-based project mapping**: Each Discord channel corresponds to a folder (e.g., `#my-project` â†’ `/path/to/repos/my-project`)
- **Persistent sessions**: Sessions are maintained per channel and automatically resume
- **Real-time streaming**: See Claude Code's tool usage and responses as they happen
- **Activity logging**: Shows up to 20 lines of activity including tool calls with parameters
- **Slash commands**: Use `/clear` to reset a session

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Discord Application

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click "New Application"
3. Give your application a name (e.g., "Claude Code Bot")
4. Click "Create"

### 2. Create a Bot User

1. In your application, go to the "Bot" section in the left sidebar
2. Click "Add Bot"
3. Under "Token", click "Copy" to copy your bot token (keep this secure!)
4. Under "Privileged Gateway Intents", enable:
   - Message Content Intent
5. Click "Save Changes"

### 3. Invite the Bot to Your Server

1. Go to the "OAuth2" â†’ "URL Generator" section
2. Under "Scopes", select:
   - `bot`
   - `applications.commands`
3. Under "Bot Permissions", select:
   - Send Messages
   - Use Slash Commands
   - Read Message History
   - Embed Links
4. Copy the generated URL and open it in your browser
5. Select your Discord server and authorize the bot

### 4. Get Your Discord User ID

1. Enable Developer Mode in Discord:
   - Go to Discord Settings â†’ Advanced â†’ Enable "Developer Mode"
2. Right-click on your username in any channel
3. Click "Copy User ID"
4. Save this ID - you'll need it for the configuration

### 5. Clone and Setup the Bot

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd claude-code-discord

# Install dependencies
bun install
```

### 6. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Discord bot token from step 2
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here

# Your Discord user ID from step 4
ALLOWED_USER_ID=your_discord_user_id_here

# Base folder containing your repositories
# Each Discord channel will map to a subfolder here
# Example: if BASE_FOLDER=/Users/you/repos and channel is #my-project
# The bot will operate in /Users/you/repos/my-project
BASE_FOLDER=/path/to/your/repos
```

### 7. Prepare Your Repository Structure

Organize your repositories under the base folder with names matching your Discord channels:

```
/path/to/your/repos/
â”œâ”€â”€ my-project/          # Maps to #my-project channel
â”œâ”€â”€ another-repo/        # Maps to #another-repo channel
â”œâ”€â”€ test-app/           # Maps to #test-app channel
â””â”€â”€ experimental/       # Maps to #experimental channel
```

**Important**: Channel names in Discord should match folder names exactly (Discord will convert spaces to hyphens).

#### Channel Name Mapping

For folders with special characters (like dots) that Discord doesn't allow in channel names, create a `channel-mappings.json` file in the project root:

```json
{
  "derivativ-ai": "derivativ.ai",
  "my-app-v2": "my.app.v2"
}
```

This allows you to map Discord channel names to folder names with special characters.

### 8. Create Discord Channels

In your Discord server, create channels for each repository:
- `#my-project`
- `#another-repo` 
- `#test-app`
- `#experimental`

### 9. Run the Bot

```bash
# Start the bot
bun run src/index.ts

# Or use the npm script
bun start
```

**Important**: Do not use hot reload (`bun --hot`) as it can cause issues with process management and spawn multiple Claude processes.

You should see:
```
Bot is ready! Logged in as Claude Code Bot#1234
Successfully registered application commands.
```

## Usage

Type any message in a channel that corresponds to a repository folder. The bot will run Claude Code with your message as the prompt and stream the results.

### Commands

- **Any message**: Runs Claude Code with your message as the prompt
- **/clear**: Resets the current channel's session (starts fresh next time)

### Example

```
You: hello
Bot: ðŸ”§ LS (path: .)
     ðŸ”§ Read (file_path: ./package.json)
     Hello! I can see this is a Node.js project. What would you like to work on?
     âœ… Completed (3 turns)
```

## How It Works

- Each Discord channel maps to a folder: `#my-project` â†’ `/path/to/repos/my-project`
- Sessions persist per channel and automatically resume
- Shows real-time tool usage and responses
- Only responds to the configured `ALLOWED_USER_ID`
